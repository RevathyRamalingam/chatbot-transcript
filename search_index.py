search_index.py
---------------
Builds and queries a minsearch index from podcast segments.

minsearch is a lightweight in-memory search library — no vector DB, 
no embeddings, no setup. It uses TF-IDF style scoring under the hood.

FIELDS WE INDEX:
  text_fields   → full-text search (minsearch tokenizes + scores these)
  keyword_fields → exact-match filters (for filtering by episode/season)

HOW TO USE:
    from search_index import build_index, search
    index = build_index(segments)
    results = search(index, "how does personalization work?")
    results = search(index, "A/B testing", video_id="IDzhmmKeNG4")  # one episode only

      - episode_title : full episode title
      - short_title   : short episode title

    Removes near-duplicate results that point to almost the same timestamp.
